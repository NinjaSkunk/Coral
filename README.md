# Coral 🐟
### Goal  🏁
  The goal of this project is to facilitate the process of mapping and understanding our ocean's coral reefs. On my website, users take pictures of coral reefs and enter the location of the coral. Then, our machine learning model classifies the coral as either healthy or unhealthy. All the data entered by users is then plotted on our map that is accessible to anyone, without the need for a log-in. 
### How Coral Was Made  🧑‍💻
  The front-end of the website is made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the GMapsAPI. The backend of the website is built with the Parse Platform and Sashido, a service that adds helpful functionalities on top of the Parse framework.
